A collection of workflow-focused ComfyUI nodes designed to simplify advanced image generation pipelines. Includes tools for flexible image padding and mask merging to enable inpainting and outpainting in a single pass, structured ControlNet application, sequential LoRA stacking (up to 10 LoRAs), a two LoRA loader with block-weight control, and reusable components for Flux-based workflows and complex image generation pipelines. Developed by
**J. L. Córdova**.

These nodes focus on improving practical workflows for modern image
generation pipelines, particularly:

- Flux workflows
- LoRA experimentation
- advanced inpainting / outpainting pipelines
- structured ControlNet pipelines

## Installation

### Using git:
Clone this repository into your **ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory**.

```
ComfyUI/
└── custom_nodes/
```

Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Damkohler/jlc-comfyui-nodes.git
```

Restart **ComfyUI** after installation.

The nodes will appear in the standard ComfyUI node menu under their
appropriate workflow categories.

### Install via ComfyUI Manager

1. Open **ComfyUI**
2. Open **Manager**
3. Search for **JLC ComfyUI Nodes**
4. Click **Install**

# Node Descriptions

## JLC Padded Image

A utility node that prepares images for **inpainting or outpainting**
by placing them on a new canvas with a specified aspect ratio and size.

### Features

- Canvas resizing with aspect ratio control
- Image placement using offset controls
- High-quality **Lanczos resampling**
- Automatic outpaint mask generation
- Optional manual mask merging
- Deterministic padding behavior

Designed to work particularly well with inpainting models such as:

```
flux1-fill-dev
```

---

## JLC Padded Latent

A higher-level workflow node that combines:

- padded image preparation
- outpaint mask generation and merge with inpaint masks
- inpaint conditioning

### Outputs

- conditioned positive prompt
- conditioned negative prompt
- latent image
- mask
- image dimensions

This node simplifies building **reusable inpainting pipelines**.

---

## JLC ControlNet Apply

A streamlined node for applying **ControlNet conditioning**
within a generation pipeline.

### Design Goals

- simplified parameter handling
- improved workflow clarity
- compatibility with Flux-based pipelines

This node adapts the built-in **ComfyUI ControlNet application logic**
for cleaner integration into custom workflows.

---

## JLC 10 LoRA Loader Stack

Applies up to **ten LoRA models sequentially** to a base model.

### Features

Each slot includes:

- selectable LoRA file
- independent strength control

Slots operate independently and are applied **in order**.

Empty slots or strengths of zero are automatically skipped.

### Inspiration

Concept inspired by the **LoRA Loader Stack** design by:

https://github.com/rgthree

---

## JLC LoRA Loader (Block Weight)

A LoRA loader with **block weight support**, allowing detailed control
over how LoRA influence is distributed across model layers.

### Features

- multiple LoRA slots
- independent model and CLIP strengths
- per-slot block weight vectors
- sequential LoRA application

This node is adapted from the implementation found in the  
**ComfyUI Inspire Pack** project.

# Design Philosophy

The nodes in this repository follow several guiding principles.

## Workflow clarity

Nodes simplify complex workflows rather than introducing additional
abstraction layers.

## Deterministic behavior

Operations such as padding, mask generation, and LoRA stacking are
implemented to behave predictably and consistently.

## Uniform documentation

Each node includes a standardized header structure containing:

- repository attribution
- node purpose description
- third-party attribution where applicable
- license information

## Metadata manifests

Each node includes a `MANIFEST` block containing metadata such as:

- node name
- version
- author
- description

These manifests support future tooling and repository indexing.

# Compatibility

Tested with:

- **ComfyUI**
- **Flux-based models**
- **LoRA-enabled pipelines**

---

# License

This repository is released under the **MIT License**.

Some nodes include adapted logic from other open-source projects.
Those sections retain their original attribution and licensing terms.

---

# Attribution

Some node concepts and implementations were inspired by existing
ComfyUI projects.
