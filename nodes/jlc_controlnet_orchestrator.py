JLC ControlNet Orchestrator
---------------------------

- JLC ComfyUI Nodes Collection
  - This node is part of the **JLC Custom Nodes for ComfyUI**
    collection developed by **J. L. Córdova**.

  - Repository
    https://github.com/Damkohler/jlc-comfyui-nodes

  - The JLC nodes focus on practical workflow improvements for
    image-generation pipelines, particularly:
        • Flux-based workflows
        • LoRA experimentation
        • advanced inpainting / outpainting pipelines
        • multi-ControlNet composition and orchestration

- Node Purpose
  - The **JLC ControlNet Orchestrator** is the external-input interface
    for building weighted multi-ControlNet workflows with the JLC
    non-recursive composition architecture.

  - Unlike **JLC ControlNet Orchestrator (Advanced)**, this node does not
    load ControlNet models internally. It receives ControlNet objects from
    upstream loader nodes, allowing model selection and loading policy to
    remain explicit in the workflow graph.

  - The node provides:
        • multiple externally supplied ControlNet slots
        • independent hint, strength, start, end, and weight controls
          for each active slot
        • isolated per-run ControlNet preparation
        • deliberate null-image handling: a `None` hint disables only its slot
        • optional order bias through the global `alpha` parameter
        • weighted non-recursive fusion through the shared JLC core

  - Each active slot:
        • receives a ControlNet base object from an upstream loader
        • creates an isolated per-run ControlNet copy
        • applies its own hint image, strength, activation range, and VAE
        • remains independent of the other prepared ControlNet instances

  - Multi-ControlNet execution uses the shared JLC linearized,
    non-recursive fusion core:

        combined = Σ [(w_i · alpha^i) · C_i(x)]

    where:
        • C_i(x) is the output of ControlNet slot `i`, evaluated
          independently against the same sampler state
        • w_i is the user-defined slot weight
        • alpha^i applies the optional order bias
        • negative weights and negative alpha values are supported

  - The fusion core:
        • does not build a recursive `previous_controlnet` chain
          between active slots
        • does not mutate upstream ControlNet base objects
        • does not use `deepcopy`
        • evaluates prepared ControlNets independently
        • clones tensors only when taking ownership of output data
        • accumulates subsequent outputs in-place
        • presents one ControlNet-compatible wrapper to the ComfyUI sampler

  - When only one effective ControlNet remains at a final weight of 1.0,
    the node uses the mathematically equivalent native single-ControlNet
    path instead of creating a composed wrapper.

  - Runtime Integration
    - The node exposes child models, hooks, lifecycle methods, and inference
      memory requirements through the interfaces expected by current ComfyUI
      sampler and model-management paths.

    - It is designed to cooperate with normal ComfyUI model management and
      DynamicVRAM behavior. It does not replace ComfyUI loading, offloading,
      patching, or device-residency policy.

    - Because ControlNet models are supplied externally, upstream loader
      nodes remain responsible for model selection, reuse, and residency
      behavior.

  - Workflow Position
    - **JLC ControlNet Orchestrator** is useful when ControlNet loading must
      remain explicit or when externally loaded ControlNet objects are shared
      elsewhere in the workflow.

    - **JLC ControlNet Orchestrator (Advanced)** is the preferred integrated
      interface for new workflows that benefit from internal model selection,
      shared-cache reuse, slot preflight, and `SHARE_PREVIOUS` behavior.

    - Both Orchestrator variants use the same validated non-recursive
      weighted-fusion algorithm.

  - MultiGPU Scope
    - The wrapper includes compatibility shunts required by current ComfyUI
      interfaces but does not implement real MultiGPU ControlNet cloning.

    - Use this node as a single-device ControlNet orchestration path unless
      explicit MultiGPU support is added in a future implementation.
